## Assignment

Here we'll implement **three representative N-objects tracking algorithms** 

* **Global Nearest Neighour, GNN**

* **Joint Probabilistic Data Association, JPDA**

* **Track-Oriented Multi-Hypotheses Tracker, TO-MHT**

and **three representative solvers for assignment problem**

* **JVC variant of Hugarian algorithm**

* **Murty's algorithm for Top K most likely assignments**

* **Gibbs sampling for Top K most likely assignments**

then evaluate their performance on both **linear** and **non-linear** simulated benchmark tracking dataset:
